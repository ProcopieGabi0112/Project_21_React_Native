*DUTCH DELIGHT MOBILE VERSION*

   1.SHORT DESCRIPTION  

     This application was designed to improve customer service. This is an application made using React Native, Firebase and JsonServer.
  Users can create an account or log in with a previously created account. After logging in, customers can see which is the menu of the day or which are the locations of our partner restaurants.
  The menu of the day is viewed through a body response given by the url 'https://mocki.io/v1/605653ce-087a-4aa5-8162-56ccae2bd38a' where the data is saved as json file. 
  The locations of the partner restaurants can be viewed below. Locations data has been saved in the same way.
  If we click on a specific location below, we will be redirected to a google maps page where we can see where the restaurant we are looking for is located.
  Users can also consult the menu, add a comment about the restaurant experience or place an order. All the data about menu, comments, or orders is stored on the Json server.
